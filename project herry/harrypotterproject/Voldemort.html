  <p>Lord Voldemort was born Tom Marvolo Riddle, a name he later abandoned, because he would not carry his father's common name forever as he had decided in his teens. His mother named him Merope Gaunt after his father and her father, and he hated it because the name Tom was a very common name, while he himself saw it as unique, but he kept it to know its origins. He assumed that his father was a wizard, and when he found that he was a commoner, he stuck to his grandfather's name to discover his relationship to Salazar Slytherin. His great-grandfather, then decided to create his new name by rearranging the letters of his name
    Lord Voldemort went into hiding for nearly ten years, spending him traveling in Britain and abroad. During these ten years, his name was established as Lord Voldemort, and he succeeded in completely erasing the personality of Tom Riddle, and his physical appearance completely changed, and he became non-human. Although the details of Voldemort's journey are unknown, Dumbledore says that he: He traveled far and wide, accompanied the worst of the wizarding race, and underwent many terrible experiences and horrific transformations. Dumbledore kept getting news during these ten years.

    <footer> Voldemort returned ten years later at Christmas to again submit a request to teach Defense Against Dark Magic to Dumbledore, who had become the director of Hogwarts at the time, but Dumbledore refused to hire him, and informed him that he knew about his journey, and about the group of his followers, the Death Eaters, who accompanied him on his long journey.
    In 1956, Voldemort created the first Death Eaters, a group of his friends who accompanied him everywhere, including: Antonin Dolohov, Traverse Mulespierre, Ivan Rosier, Nott (the father of Theodore Nott, whose first name may also be Theodore), and Avery. Rowling said that the Death Eaters' old name is the Knights of Walburg.
    After his request was rejected for the second time, Voldemort left for a while and began to spread his philosophy calling for the promotion of the purity of magical blood, and the expulsion of people of common origins from the magical community. His call received a wide echo in the pure-blooded magical community, so entire families joined him, and the number of Death Eaters increased, and with him Voldemort's influence increased.
    His group caused great harm, riots, and was completely outlawed.</footer> 
    
    
    <footer>  It also spread enormous terror in Britain, and Voldemort showed great ability to persuade by including giants and goblins into his army. The reign of terror and control began in the seventies when Voldemort split the magical community into two hostile fronts, and the war between him and The ministry has been raging since the late sixties.
    Because of his prowess at working undercover, the Ministry was unable to infiltrate his forces while he had eyes for them, and according to what the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, claimed in his conversation with the Muggle Prime Minister in 1996, the Ministry of Magic pursued Voldemort and attempted to capture him for a period of nearly thirty years. Using his control over animals, he recruited creatures of darkness into his army, and attacked the Ministry with dragons, dementors, and the undead. Werewolves, vampires, giants, dwarves, and demi-humans also joined his ranks.
    Albus Dumbledore recruited a group of trusted wizards close to him to confront Voldemort and his army. He called them the Order of the Phoenix after his phoenix, Fawkes, whose feather provided Voldemort with magical power. He worked in a cunning disguise, imitating Voldemort's methods. Dumbledore was able to achieve some success in infiltrating Voldemort's ranks and limiting the influence of the Death Eaters with the Ministry's wizards, who were granted powers by Bartemius Crouch Sr. to use forbidden spells against the Death Eaters, and the violence between the two parties increased. But the Order of the Phoenix's luck with the Death Eaters did not last long, as Voldemort oppressed them, and the Death Eaters killed half of them.
    Voldemort's reign of power continued until 1980, when Sybil Trelawney predicted the birth of the one with the power that would vanquish the Prince of Darkness. Only the first part of the prophecy was transmitted to him by Severus Snape, so he decided to eliminate the next child who would bring death to him.</p>
