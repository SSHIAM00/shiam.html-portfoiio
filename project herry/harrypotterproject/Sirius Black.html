<p>Sirius Black is Harry Potter's godfather, and was the best friend of James Potter, Harry's father
  Sirius Black was born in 1959 to parents from the last branches of the ancient Black magical family, which is linked by blood and affinity with most of the powerful and influential magical families, Orion and Walburga Black. He grew up as a prince of a royal lineage, an upbringing that was reflected in his self-confidence and nobility, as well as in his commanding style of dealing.
  Sirius Black, who was naturally rebellious, was not familiar with the traditional and puritanical nature of his family's life. He was unable to deal with his parents, who were obsessed with the purity of blood, and with his younger brother, Regulus, who adopted his parents' ideas. His years at Hogwarts were an escape for him from his family, and an outlet during which he practiced his rebellion.
  When Sirius Black was eleven years old, he entered Hogwarts, and the Sorting Hat classified him into Gryffindor.

  There he met his best friend and partner in all the trouble they did together, James Potter, and he also met their third friend, Remus Lupine, and the three of them, along with Peter Pettigrew, became the Four Plunderers.
  As a result of their desire to accompany their werewolf friend Lupine during his transformation periods, the three friends studied arcane branches of magic, and they were all able to illegally become mutant wizards at a young age. Sirius was transformed into a large black dog, and he adopted the nickname Padfoot in the gang, to continue their explorations and adventures together. .
  Black was a naughty student, prone to cruelty, and along with his friend James Potter, it was difficult for anyone to control them, so they set off at school messing around as they pleased without being deterred by the many punishments they were subjected to together as a result of their naughtiness.
  Black developed a personal feud that developed over the years with his colleague from the house of Slytherin, Severus Snape, along with his friend Potter, and they made it their mission to humiliate him, harm him, and oppress him in every way possible, because they hated his delving into the arts of black magic, and as Potter says, they “hated his mere existence.”
  As a result of this hatred, Black decided to play a cruel game on Snape. He convinced him to follow Lupine to Shrecking House, where Lupine was spending his periods transforming into a werewolf. Snape found himself in a fatal confrontation with a werewolf, but James Potter saved him.

  The animosity between Black and Snape continued, and its effects extended to cause... With disastrous future results.
 Black was not happy with his parents, who exhausted him with their obsession with traditions and purity of blood, while he was rebellious against all traditions, and wanted to live freely away from all family complications. Black hated all his family members from an early age, and developed a great enmity with them as well, which ended with him leaving his home. His family and his move to live in James Potter's family home until he owned his own house, which he obtained through a will from an uncle whom he loved, called Alfred Black. As a result of his abandoning the family home, his name was removed from the family tree, and he was called a blood traitor.</p>
