<p>Harry James Potter was born on July 30, 1980, to wizard parents: James Potter and Willie Evans (after marriage, Lily Potter).
  And before birth, Potter had a prophecy about (the Chosen One), who would be the end of the Dark Lord at his hands.
  The first part of the prophecy reached Voldemort, who sought Harry Potter's request. On October 30, 1980, Voldemort broke into the well-protected home of the Potter family after Wormtail revealed her secret, and everyone thought that Sirius Black was the one who revealed the secret. He died. James Willie Potter, but the offensive spell he cast on the infant Harry Potter resonated with him, causing him to leave his body and become filled with power. Voldemort's reign of power ended, and he was sent into exile. As for baby Harry, he only had a lightning-like scar on his forehead, which became the link between him and Lord Voldemort.
  Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, sent the infant Harry Potter to the house of the only relative left to him in this world, his aunt Petunia Dursley, who had a bad relationship with her murdered sister, and she and her husband, Vernon Dursley, hated the wizarding world. She left a message for her in his cradle explaining the reasons for spreading it. .
  <footer>  Potter grew up in deprivation and was a typical orphan seeking twilight, where he was constantly misunderstood and neglected. The Dursley family was keen to ignore Harry Potter's wizarding origins and avoid mentioning them publicly. Harry told us that his parents died in a car accident caused by drunkenness, and they exaggerated... Restoring the image of his parents.
  As Harry Potter approached his nineteenth birthday, strange owl-shaped letters began to arrive to him, addressed to his name, but Vernon Darcy prevented him from receiving the letters, and sent his family on Harry's birthday to a cabin on the lake to avoid these letters from reaching Harry's hands. .
  However, it began Harry Potter Comprehensive XII, the giant's door, and his assistants stormed his birthday message at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and birthday cake. But the most important thing that Rubeus Hagrid presented was the truth about Harry Potter and his family.
  And he has his mother's green eyes. He knew that they were attractive, the new wizard was like them, and he knew that they died defending him at his famous altar, Voldemort was (the child who survived).</p>
