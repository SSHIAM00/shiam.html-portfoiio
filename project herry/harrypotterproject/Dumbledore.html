  <p>Dumbledore was described as an elderly wizard with long white hair, a white beard that extended to his belt, which he sometimes tied into it, and whose original hair color was reddish-brown.
    He is tall and thin, with clear blue eyes, and his hooked nose appears to have been broken at least twice before. Despite being old, his appearance gave the impression of energy and vitality, but Harry Potter notices signs of aging appearing on Dumbledoreâ€™s face and movements in the year he died, i.e. 1997. After drinking the magic liquid in the cave where he went with Harry Potter before his death His face became pale as death, and the color of his eyes changed to green. Dumbledore said that he had a scar in the shape of a London Underground station above his knee, without specifying why he got it. In 1996, he was injured in his right hand, in which he carries the wand, and it became black, burned, and withered, and remained that way until his death.
    Dumbledore wears magical cloaks of strange colors, tall magic hats with spiders walking on them, and he also constantly wears crescent-shaped glasses. In 1938, he went to fetch Tom Riddle from a public orphanage, wearing a long purple cloak that attracted the attention of all passers-by to his strange appearance. After obtaining Marvolo Gaunt's ring, he wore it on his left hand permanently.

    Dumbledore has an energetic air about him, and has been described as an eccentric genius, and he has shown a certain eccentricity in the series since his first appearance. He is characterized by dignity and calm, and tends to be peaceful, except when it comes to Lord Voldemort. He trusts those around him greatly, and tends to believe in the predominance of goodness in creatures. Dumbledore was described as cunning in the book Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and in the same book he expressed extreme hostility towards Lord Voldemort, declaring that just killing him would not be enough for him. Dumbledore's beliefs are considered revolutionary in the wizarding world. He believes in the rights of magical creatures, including goblins, giants, and house elves. He is not hostile to werewolves, but rather sympathizes with them. He always reads public 
    newspapers to find out their news, something that the rest of the wizards refuse to believe. In addition, he made a series of courageous decisions at Hogwarts, including keeping Rubeus Hagrid, who was accused of opening the Chamber of Secrets, in the school, and entrusting him with many assignments, appointing Severus Snape, the former Death Eater, as a potions teacher, and appointing Remus Lupine, the werewolf, as a Defense Against Dark Magic teacher. Appointing the centaur Fernz as a divination teacher, and allowing Moody, the one with the crazy eye, to teach unforgiveable spells to the students, contrary to the Ministry's orders.
    Dumbledore is brave and bold, and he always follows unconventional methods, and does not care much about his critics. His appearance in the Department of Oddities and Secrets caused panic among the Death Eaters, and he was able to arrest all of them except Bellatrix Lestrange, whom Voldemort took with him when he left the Ministry. 
    
    <footer> No one stood up to confront him except Voldemort, who later withdrew, and despite his withdrawal, this battle affected Dumbledore's health.
    Dumbledore can make himself invisible without an invisibility cloak, and without using any spells or magical tools. He can also use magic without his magic wand, and he possesses many magical abilities, a large part of which has not been revealed yet. At the beginning of the series, Minerva McGonagall indicated that he possessed enormous power that his morals prevented him from using, but he denied this. His knowledge of the ways of ancient magic constituted his main strength in confronting Voldemort, who ignores types of ancient magic because he does not like them, or because he is ignorant of them. He is also able to speak the language of nymphs and ghouls.</p>
