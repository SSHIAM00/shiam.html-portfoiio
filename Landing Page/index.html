        <p>Trampoline :In trampoline gymnastics, gymnasts perform high flips and flips on each jump. This became an Olympic discipline for the 2000 Olympics.
          To add trampoline players to the gymnastics quota, the artistic teams were reduced from seven team members to six.
          Events: Mandatory and voluntary routines are performed in Olympic competitions. Each consists of ten skills and is performed on the same type of trampoline.
          Mini-double (gymnasts use a trampoline two levels smaller) and synchro (two athletes perform at the same time on different trampolines) are competitive events in the United States, but not in the Olympics.</p>

          Tumbling: Power tumbling is performed on a spring runway much bouncier than the floor exercise mat used in artistic gymnastics. Because of its spring, athletes are able to perform very complicated flips and twists in succession.
          The events: All tumbling is done on the same strip. The gymnast performs two passes in each stage of the competition, with eight elements in each pass.</p>
        <p>
          Competition: Tumbling is not an Olympic event, but is part of the Junior Olympic program in the United States and is competed internationally as well.

          The events competed are men’s pairs, women’s pairs, mixed pairs, women’s groups (three gymnasts) and men’s groups (four gymnasts).</p>
